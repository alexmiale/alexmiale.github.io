            Welcome to my website! This space will be used to post different projects and provide updates for what I am doing. 
            Currently, this will be focused on providing explanations and visualizations for data analysis in sports, primarily soccer.
            Soccer is a passion of mine and I enjoy watching and playing it, and finding out about data analysis was very exciting for me.
