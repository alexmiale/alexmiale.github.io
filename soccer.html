            Welcome to my the blog! This is where I will talk about and show different data visualizations for analysis of soccer matches. 
            There are a number of languages and libraries used for doing analytics, but the best publicly available resources are through 
            Python and its <a href="https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">soccermpl</a> library. 
            Companies like <a href="https://github.com/statsbomb">Statsbomb</a> provide open source data 
            to use which has lots of different kinds of data. You can select data from different competetions and countries, players 
            and teams, all the way down to individual events (pass, shot, etc). 
            <br><br>
            Visualization in soccer is very important. It allows teams to visualize their performance of a game objectively and fans to view
            how well their team performed. The visualizations can be as simple as a table showing numerical stats like possesion and shots to 
            get a summary of how the game went overall or as complex as a heat map of player's position during a game or season. All of these
            are useful in developing tactics and analyzing a team's or player's performance. 
            <br><br>
            With the increase in technology over the past 15 years, it has become completely interwoven into the preparation phase of most sports. 
            The data collected helps teams identify players to acquire, prepare for the upcoming season and each game, analyze the other team, and 
            prevent injuries. Some may argue that this level of injection of technology has "ruined the game", but I find the analysis fascinating 
            and very helpful for the teams.
